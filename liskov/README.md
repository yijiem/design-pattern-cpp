# liskov substitution principle

## overview

The LSP is a guideline of whether a class should be designed as a subclass
of another class. It states that if class S is a subclass of class T,
then object of type T can be replaced by object of type S without any 
modification of behavior such as production codes and test codes.

Private inheritance and composition can be used to resolve the case when
inheritance goes against the LSP.
